# fundamentals-of-progamming-portfolio
Contains all my fundamentals of programming projects and assignments
The Fundamentals of Programming course taught the fundamentals of programming in various languages.
Thus the projects in this repository are in different languages including: Javascript, Prolog et. al

NB: LogIn Interface assignment was implemented in c++, Python and Java (not JavaScript)
That was just a minor error from my end.
I promise I know the difference between Java and JavaScript
